   Promise.any() behavior:
It resolves as soon as any one of the input promises fulfills (i.e., succeeds).

If all promises reject, then it rejects with an AggregateError.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Promise.race() returns a promise that:

Settles (resolves or rejects) as soon as the first promise settles, whether itâ€™s fulfilled or rejected.
